# Etymol Game Development

## Current State
- Web-based etymology tree guessing game
- D3.js visualization of word trees
- English words highlighted in gold (both revealed and redacted)
- Glosses shown as text labels below words
- Reveal All button for giving up
- Clean, dark theme UI

## Key Design Decisions
1. Tree Generation:
   - Minimum 5 nodes per tree
   - At least 4 English words required
   - At least 1 branching point
   - Prefer trees with multiple branches
   - Score based on language variety and tree complexity

2. UI/UX:
   - Dark theme for better readability
   - Gold highlighting for English words (both revealed and redacted)
   - Glosses shown as text labels (not tooltips)
   - Reveal All button in red to indicate give-up action
   - Feedback messages for correct/incorrect guesses

3. Game Logic:
   - Words revealed when guessed or when all children are revealed
   - English words are the target words to guess
   - Clue word is pre-revealed
   - Related words list for validation

## Development Notes
- Keep game_data.js in git (generated data)
- Exclude word_frequencies.txt (downloaded data)
- Maintain clean, semantic git commits
- Focus on intuitive UI without explanatory text

## Next Steps
- Consider adding difficulty levels
- Maybe add hints system
- Could add statistics tracking
- Might add more visual polish
